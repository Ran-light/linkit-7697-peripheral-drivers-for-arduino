        "As you have seen during the __Linear Circuits A__, when solving a circuit using nodal analysis we usually end up with linear equations with node voltages as the unknown variables. So far, we have been solving these equations by hand, but this is both time consuming and not practical in larger circuits. An efficient and fast way to solve these system of linear equations is to represent them as matrix multiplication and solve them using matrix inversion. This approach is very common in large scale mathematical modeling and simulation because by doing so we can later use many different and efficient programming tools designed for the task. \n",

In this case you will get an error when calculating $G^{-1}$ and you need to make a new circuit as noted before. Another case that may happen is that your graph is disconnected and one part is only connected to loads like in circuit 2. Since we consider loads as negative current sources your code will work with no error but you will get negative values for some node voltages. This is fine for simulation and you don't need to make a new circuit but you have to be carefull that this is not a valid circuit in practice and part of your circuit won't turn on at all as there is no source. One other issue is that some nodes may be connected only by resistors in an open circuit like nodes $N_0$ and $N_1$ in circuit 3.
